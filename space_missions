-- Finding out which was the First Space Mission and Most Recent One:


-- First Space Mission:

SELECT TOP 1 Mission, Company, CONVERT(DATE,[Date]) AS only_date, MissionStatus
  FROM space_missions
  GROUP BY Mission, company, date, MissionStatus
  ORDER BY date ASC
  
  --Most Recent Mission:
  
  SELECT TOP 1 Mission, Company, CONVERT(DATE,[Date]) AS only_date, MissionStatus
  FROM space_missions
  GROUP BY Mission, company, date, MissionStatus
  ORDER BY date DESC
  
  
 -- Which Company had the most Space Missions (Top 10):
 
SELECT TOP 10 Company, COUNT (Company) AS number_of_missions
  FROM space_missions
  GROUP BY company
  ORDER BY number_of_missions DESC
  
  
-- Which Location had the most launches (Top 10):

SELECT TOP 10 Location, COUNT (location) AS number_of_launches
  FROM space_missions
  GROUP BY location
  ORDER BY number_of_launches DESC
  
 
 -- Number and percentage of Active and Retired Rockets:
 
 --Number
 SELECT RocketStatus, COUNT (RocketStatus) AS number_of_rockets
  FROM space_missions
  GROUP BY RocketStatus 

--Percentage
  SELECT RocketStatus,
 round( count(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT count(*) FROM space_missions) , 1) AS percentage_active_and_retired
 FROM space_missions
 GROUP BY RocketStatus
 
 
 -- Time of the day that had most launches:
 
 SELECT TOP 5 CONVERT(time,[time]) AS only_time, COUNT (CONVERT(time,[time])) AS time_of_the_day
 FROM space_missions
 WHERE time IS NOT NULL
 GROUP BY time
 ORDER BY time_of_the_day DESC
 
 
 -- Time in history that had the most Missions: 
 
 -- First, I altered the table to add a columns with which decades the launches occurred:
 
 ALTER TABLE space_missions
ADD Decades AS (CASE
 WHEN date >= '1957-10-04' AND date <= '1959-11-26' THEN '50s'
 WHEN date >= '1960-02-04' AND date <= '1969-12-27' THEN '60s'
 WHEN date >= '1970-01-09' AND date <= '1979-12-24' THEN '70s'
  WHEN date >= '1980-01-11' AND date <= '1989-12-27' THEN '80s'
   WHEN date >= '1990-01-01' AND date <= '1999-12-31' THEN '90s'
   WHEN date >= '2000-01-21' AND date <= '2009-12-18' THEN '00s'
   WHEN date >= '2010-02-03' AND date <= '2019-12-27' THEN '2010s'
 ELSE '2020s'
 END)
 
 
-- Then, I entered the query to find the number of missions per Decade:

SELECT Decades, COUNT (Mission) AS number_of_missions
 FROM space_missions
 GROUP BY Decades
 ORDER BY 2,1
 
 
 --Number of Success and Failures per Decade:
 
 SELECT COUNT (Mission) AS number_of_missions, MissionStatus, Decades
  FROM space_missions
  GROUP BY Decades, MissionStatus
  ORDER BY Decades DESC
  
  -- Number of Success and Failures in total:
  
  SELECT MissionStatus, COUNT (Mission) AS number_of_missions
  FROM space_missions
  GROUP BY  MissionStatus
